# BearStock_Management_API_GFTBootcamp

* In this project I was able to undertand how to build unit tests, and how to use TDD to develope my code.
* It's a simple API to manage a Beer Stock, where the user can specify the name, brand, quantity in stock and the max stock's capacity. It also can delete the beer, increment or decrement the quantity and consult the already registered beer as well.
